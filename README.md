# Dairy-management
 The Dairy Management System is a robust and feature-rich application that simplifies the management of
 dairy farms.
           Leveraging Java Swings for an intuitive front-end and Oracle SQL for a reliable back-end, this system offers
 dairy farm owners the tools they need to enhance productivity data accuracy, and overall farm management.
 All create, insert, update and delete operations are supported in this project for complete curd representation.
